This unofficial copy of PhantomJS 2.0 was referenced in 
[this post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/phantomjs/cgTH-jqCSGg/RGWsAHiVSZAJ),
which links to http://www.datafilehost.com/d/07ca4477, but you can't script
downloads from that site, so I've unpacked it and included the contents here
for Travis to use in testing.
