# NodeFlow

A JavaScript Netflow/IPFIX collector and graphing tool.

Written in Node.JS, to make use of
[Node-Netflowd](https://github.com/Sghazzawi/Node-Netflowd), but runs in the
browser with [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).
Designed according to the principles discussed in
[Cross platform JavaScript with Browserify â€“ Sharing Code Between Node.js and the Browser](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2014/02/cross-platform-javascript/).

## Usage

To install dependencies on a freshly checked-out project:

	npm install

To run the built-in RabbitMQ client and WebSocket server, to receive
messages from pmacct and forward them to connected in-browser clients:

	grunt server

To lint and start the server:

	grunt

After starting the server, you can connect to this server using your
browser with the test client, and see Netflow messages from pmacct on the
console, by visiting this URL:

* http://localhost:8080/sockjs-client.html
