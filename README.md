NodeFlow
========

A JavaScript Netflow/IPFIX collector and graphing tool.

Written in Node.JS, to make use of
[Node-Netflowd](https://github.com/Sghazzawi/Node-Netflowd), but runs in the
browser with [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).
Designed according to the principles discussed in
[Cross platform JavaScript with Browserify â€“ Sharing Code Between Node.js and the Browser](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2014/02/cross-platform-javascript/).
